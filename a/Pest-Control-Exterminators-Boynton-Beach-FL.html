Undoubtedly, we discovered lots of concrete indicators that Integrated Pest Management (IPM) has attained global recognition and prevalent (international?) acceptance.

<p>The idea of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable strategy for managing pests, has actually remained in practice for a very long time. Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt toxic substances are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Freezer is also considered a physical control and, although it does not always eliminate the insect pests, it at least stops their development and further feeding on the stored crop.</p>
<p>The habits of the pest can be made use of for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and breeding disruption methods (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). When distributed in the field or put in traps, baits including harmful material will bring in and eliminate the pests. </p>
<p>The lots of varying risks from pests make it advisable for cultural heritage companies to establish an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and buildings. In these nations, regular usage of pesticides is limited to high worth (cash) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mostly centered on cotton, rice, soybean, and sugarcane.</p>
