A single spotting of any pest in a storage facility throughout an audit can indicate a great deal of damage to the reputation-wise and company-financial. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your belongings with poisonous chemicals, damage the air quality in your home or business, possibly infect food and other perishables, and just eliminates pests at the surface of the issue.</p>
