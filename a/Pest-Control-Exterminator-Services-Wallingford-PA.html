<p>If pesticides are essential, they are picked and applied in a way that avoids interrupting other IPM practices. Practically every kind of pest poses a danger to the homes they occupy, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the implementation of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or highly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
<p>When stored for a long time, kept product pests are most likely to be in a food active ingredient on delivery to a processing factory or a processed food product. Using pesticides to crops, animals, structures or landscapes on a regular basis, regardless of need, is not IPM. The dependence on pesticides as a sole method of control has actually resulted in the development of insect resistance and negative effects on human health, natural opponents, and the environment.</p>
