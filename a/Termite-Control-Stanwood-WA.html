<p>On the other hand, organic food production applies a number of the exact same concepts as IPM however restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to decrease the requirement for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides. </p>
