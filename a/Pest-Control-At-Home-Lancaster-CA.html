<p>No matter what kind of pest your operation requires to manage, having a pest management professional on your team is a reliable method to reduce the threat of contamination to food. They inspect areas for evidence of pests like insects and rodents consisting of ants, roaches, termites, mosquitoes, and insects, and normally produce treatment strategies to eliminate or avoid pest problems.</p>
<p>Part of this success originated from field schools which permitted regional farmers to harness their native knowledge of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the selection and use of pest control actions that will guarantee favourable financial condition, social and environmental effects 13 and is applicable to the majority of agricultural, public health and feature pest management circumstances.</p>
<p>Pests that follow a specific seasonal pattern can be managed by changing planting dates.

Recognition of pest hazard warrants taking correct steps to eradicate harmful pests, combining different approaches and eliminating the chemical control repercussions.</p>
<p>Chemical pesticides are categorized into various groups based on their mode of action (IRAC 2018) and turning chemicals from different mode of action groups is suggested to reduce the threat of resistance advancement (Stimulates and Nauen 2015 ).

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) combines different kinds of controls-- from hands-on pest removal to conventional synthetic pesticides-- in a reasonable, long-term plan. Biopesticides are generally suitable with natural enemies, but there are exceptions.</p>
