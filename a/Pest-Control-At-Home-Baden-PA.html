In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest efficient dosage when other techniques of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based method that focuses on long-term avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of strategies such as biological control, environment adjustment, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>
