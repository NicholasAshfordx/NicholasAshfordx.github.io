<p>Natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be very efficient in triggering significant reductions in pest populations in particular situations (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially readily available natural enemies or saving natural enemy populations by providing refuges or preventing practices that harm them are a few of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>
