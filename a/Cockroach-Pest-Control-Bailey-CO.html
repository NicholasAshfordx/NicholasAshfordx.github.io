<p>Recognition of the pest, comprehending its biology and seasonal population trends, damaging life phases and their environments, nature of the damage and its financial significance, the vulnerability of each life stage for one or more control choices, host choice and alternate hosts, predictability of pest incident based upon the environment, cropping trends, farming practices, and other influencing aspects, and all the associated information is important for determining an effective control technique.</p>

In a metaanalysis of information of 145 studies, the effectiveness of either predators or parasitoids was demonstrated to be good in minimizing the variety of pests and increasing pest death (Stiling and Cornelissen, 2005).</p>
<p>Socio-psychological aspects consisting of ethical and logical considerations were found to the drivers in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease event and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that an absence of qualified IPM specialists and extension teachers was an obstacle for IPM application in developed countries.</p>
