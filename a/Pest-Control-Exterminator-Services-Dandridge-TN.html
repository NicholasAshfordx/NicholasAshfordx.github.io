Use the least quantity of pesticide possible, as all pesticides are poisonous and can trigger harm if used incorrectly. After making the decision to implement controls, the various control choices should be thoroughly picked, based on efficiency and human and ecological safety.</p>
<p>The habits of the pest can be exploited for its tracking and control through baits, traps, and mating disruption techniques (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ).
