For example, stress of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thereby increasing the possibility that some will survive insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>

Physical barriers such as fences, nets, mulch, and tree trunk guards can exclude pests and minimize the damage they inflict.</p>
