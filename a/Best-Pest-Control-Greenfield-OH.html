<p>This might consist of using several pesticides with various modes of action. Trap crops are planted to draw in and hold pest insects where they can be handled more efficiently and avoid or minimize their movement onto important crops.

Termites need wetness for their survival, thus moist walls, leak and water seepage resemble open invites for them.</p>
