<p>More info is needed about food-chain concentration and practical ways of removing harmful impacts of pesticide residues that may stay in the environment after the pesticides have served their purpose. Don't base pest management programs on overall removal of a pest. Pests attack plants from everywhere: rodents and nematode spoil roots in the earth, snails, and larvae destroy berries and leaves coming from the ground, and birds eat up fruit and seeds attacking from the air.</p>
<p>This approach of pest control has fallen out of favour in recent years because fire eliminates advantageous insects along with the pests and can have a negative effect on the soil. To decrease potential harm to beneficial insects, restrict your spraying to small areas where you can see pests prowling, and leave a number of unsprayed "havens" for any excellent bugs you can't see.</p>
