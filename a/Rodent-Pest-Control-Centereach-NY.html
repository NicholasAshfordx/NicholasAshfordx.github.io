Don't base pest management programs on overall removal of a pest. Pests attack plants from everywhere: rodents and nematode spoil roots in the earth, snails, and larvae destroy berries and leaves coming from the ground, and birds eat up fruit and seeds attacking from the air.</p>
<p>This approach of pest control has fallen out of favour in recent years because fire eliminates advantageous insects along with the pests and can have a negative effect on the soil. To decrease potential harm to beneficial insects, restrict your spraying to small areas where you can see pests prowling, and leave a number of unsprayed "havens" for any excellent bugs you can't see.</p>
