<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, correct watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the ecosystem as a whole and considers a well balanced mix of the abovementioned control methods to produce the most reliable and least destructive plan.</p>
<p>As talked about previously, understanding about the environmental interrelationships between insects and their environment is vital to effective pest management. Recently, the European Union has embraced IPM as a policy for management of insect pests. If outsourced, the food business should recognize it has an equal role to play in pest control" with the pest management expert, states Dr. Siddiqi. </p>
<p>The global quotes vary in magnitude, but it is believed roughly 25% of crops are lost to diseases and pests, such as insects, fungis and other plant pathogens (FAO Crop Potential Customers and Food Scenario 2009). Applications of pesticides should reach their designated targets. However there are a lot of pest control companies out there in Chandigarh and they all have various level of quality and service standard, so naturally there charge differently.</p>
