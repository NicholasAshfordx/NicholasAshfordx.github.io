Termites eat furnishings, papers, books, and even documents kept in lockers and safes, therefore triggering colossal damage within just a few months. This stops the pest acquiring resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or used to the crops. Exterminators go to customer homes and organisations to check for insects or rodents.
