The Indian Pest Control Association (IPCA) is a non-profit trade association of expert pest management companies in India. Chemical control normally refers to using synthetic chemical pesticides (Pimental 2009 ). Nevertheless, to be technically precise, chemical control needs to consist of artificial chemicals as well as chemicals of botanical or microbial origin.</p>
<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a reliable and ecologically sensitive  approach to pest management that counts on a mix of sensible practices. IPM is an approach to guarantee financial viability at both consumer and manufacturer level (seller is constantly anticipated to make a profit), environmental security through a well balanced use of all readily available pest control options, and social reputation since IPM-based food is budget-friendly and safe.</p>

Select a pesticide that is pest particular, if offered; remember, do not kill the advantageous insects. However the exterminators not only help you in eliminating the pests from your home, but they ensure the pests will not return. IPM stresses the use of non-chemical control techniques, such as exemption or trapping, before chemical options.</p>
<p>A smaller sized subset of growers use less dangerous pesticides such as scents. This can be as basic as introducing the natural predator of a specific type of pest into your environment. IPM indicates responding to pest problems with the most effective, least-risk alternative.
