The pesticides applied will be as specific as possible for the target and will have the least adverse effects on human health, non-target organisms and the environment. Termite control, on the basis of insect type, accounted for the biggest share in 2016 owing to its higher demand in residential and industrial sectors for pre- & post-construction treatment and wood home treatment, respectively.</p>
<p>This physical control puts an instant end to pests' plant-damaging days. Pesticides not included in traps or baits need to generally only be applied to targeted areas, not sprayed over the whole space.

TAP insulation for attics, moisture barriers for crawl areas, and specially engineered weather stripping for garage and entry doors not just deter rodents and other devastating pests from living and getting in in your house, they're energy effective, too.</p>
