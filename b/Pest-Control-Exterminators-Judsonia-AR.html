<p>1. Chemical Pest Control. Pests can be big barrier to the growth of your business. However, some specialists interpret IPM as turning chemicals from various mode of action groups to maintain pest control efficacy and reduce pesticide resistance with a focus on reducing pest damage. Entomopathogenic nematodes can be utilized against specific soil pests, germs, and viruses against pests with chewing mouthparts such as Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, while fungis work versus a range of pests.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was hence associated with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be applied only after routine tracking indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the financial limit) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would surpass the expense of the control procedures.</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly accomplish levels at which damage is triggered hence becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For example, a rich community likely will have a lot of large, pricey houses, so pest control expenses might be greater there because there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in one of those homes. </p>
