Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt toxic substances are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Cold storage is also thought about a physical control and, although it does not always eliminate the insect pests, it at least stops their development and further feeding on the stored crop.</p>
<p>Likewise, consider how the variety of plants to be grown in the same area may affect ease of pesticide applications and spread of illness. Pest control pertains to non-lethal approaches too, such as keeping the location tidy and totally free of any food particles or other attractants, sealing up entry ways such as cracks in walls or the area between the bottom of the flooring and a door.</p>
