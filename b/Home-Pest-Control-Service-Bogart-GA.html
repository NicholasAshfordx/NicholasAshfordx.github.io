Crops are typically monocultures, including a single crop types, which produces a homogenous environment typically doing not have key requirements of natural opponents, therefore favoring pest species.</p>
<p>There are numerous approaches to natural pest and weed management that-- when used together-- can help avoid the need for herbicides and pesticides. All users are advised to constantly seek advice from a signed up health care expert for medical diagnosis and answers to their medical questions and to determine whether the specific therapy, treatment, product or service described on the site is suitable in their scenarios.</p>

IPM considers the ecosystem as a whole and takes into consideration a well balanced mix of the abovementioned control techniques to produce the most efficient and least harmful plan.</p>
