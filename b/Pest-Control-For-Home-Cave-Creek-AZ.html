<p>In the majority of cropping systems, insecticides are still the principal methods of controlling pests once the financial threshold has been reached. You can see that while these words can be related to pest control, they also recommend that you can anticipate successful pest elimination from this business or brand name. Integrated Pest Management is a decision-making process in which observations, including assessment and monitoring, are used to make pest control decisions based on pre-determined management goals.</p>
<p>Link to PRI's Pest Management Bulletins to discover low-impact approaches of pest control that lessen pesticide usage and direct exposure.

After implementing any pest management strategy, examine the sign plants to evaluate if arthropod pests have been eliminated and assess the efficiency and longevity of control.</p>
