<p>Biological Control: Using useful creatures such as insects or fungi that damage the weeds. Less emphasis is put on how natural enemies function and how we can promote their natural efficiency. Think about soil or substrate health not just in the biological sense: minimal existence of soil borne pests or illness.

<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and discourage pest persistence include intercropping (multiple crops in the exact same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests far from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
