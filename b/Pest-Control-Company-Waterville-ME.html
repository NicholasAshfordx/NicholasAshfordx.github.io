<p>For some jobs, pest control workers use a mix of pest management strategies, a practice called incorporated pest management. The foundation of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of routine assessments.

<p>The human response depends on the significance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to entirely eliminate the pest. Current experiences with bug pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be used for essential examples in the discussion. The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) refers to pest control and avoidance programs that depend on a number of simultaneous methods to acquire the preferred result.</p>
