The chemical controls are applied only after routine monitoring indicates that a pest population had actually reached a financial limit level. Numerous specific commodity growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to define what IPM suggests for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in limited areas.</p>
