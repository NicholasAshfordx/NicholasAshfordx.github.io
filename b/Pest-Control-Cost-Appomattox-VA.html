Applications of pesticides are always the last hope in an IPM program. This is discussed in Chapter 16.

<p>Kaolin particle movies used in natural farming might control some pests, but can adversely impact natural opponents and trigger other pests to proliferate (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices might motivate natural opponent populations, but a greater number of natural enemies does not constantly lead to pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling utilize fossil fuels and indirectly have a negative impact on the environment.</p>
