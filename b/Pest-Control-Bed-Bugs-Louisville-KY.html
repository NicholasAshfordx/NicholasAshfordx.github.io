<p>The most reliable method for managing pests is to integrate methods in an approach referred to as Integrated Pest Management (IPM). A typical pitfall most organisations encounter is explaining their business name too literally by using tired pest control terms like control, insecticide, management, and pesticide. The pest management market is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and around 150,000 pest control service personnel. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, bedbugs, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow coats, bees and flies are frequently found pests in our society.</p>

<p>If you end up employing a pest-control service, search-- there are big differences in quality, and you don't have to pay more for excellent service.

<p>Constant surveillance and monitoring of insect pests population is necessary for assessment of damage and for determining the needs for actions to be taken.
