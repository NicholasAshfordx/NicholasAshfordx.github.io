Pest exclusion with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to remove pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>

<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, stick around in the environment for days, weeks or perhaps longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an essential part of an integrated pest management programme. However by focusing on non-chemical options initially, you can make sure that your pest management program is successfully removing pests at the least risk to your food safety program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
